# sentimentanalysis
Using the Amazon product reviews dataset, I have created a model that predicts whether a given review is positive or negative. This is to help firms to improve the quality of products and services based on users reviews. Many businesses out there look at the reviews and make the required changes. SO, this is the project that helps firms to easily predict the sentiment of user reviews. 
I have performed 
Data preprocessing, 
Data Visualization, 
Converting the Text into Vector using Natural Language Processing, 
Random Over Sampling to resample the data i.e to convert the data into balanced data, 
thereby predicting the accuracy using multiple NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. 
Finally, I got the accuracy of 0.987 by using the GridSearchCV().
