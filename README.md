# sentimentanalysis
Using the Amazon product reviews dataset, I have created a model that predicts whether a given review is positive, negative or normal. This is to help firms to improve the quality of products and services based on users reviews. Many businesses out there look at the reviews and make the required changes. SO, this is the project that helps firms to easily predict the sentiment of users reviews.
